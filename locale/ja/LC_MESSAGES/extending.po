"A CadQuery plugin is simply a function that is attached to the CadQuery "

#: ../../cadquery/doc/extending.rst:60
msgid "The Stack"
msgstr ""

#: ../../cadquery/doc/extending.rst:62
msgid ""
"Every CadQuery object has a local stack, which contains a list of items.  "
"The items on the stack will be one of these types:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../cadquery/doc/extending.rst:65
msgid ""
"**A CadQuery SolidReference object**, which holds a reference to a OCP solid"
msgstr ""

#: ../../cadquery/doc/extending.rst:66
msgid ""
"**A OCP object**, a Vertex, Edge, Wire, Face, Shell, Solid, or Compound"
msgstr ""

#: ../../cadquery/doc/extending.rst:68
msgid ""
"The stack is available by using self.objects, and will always contain at "
"least one object."
msgstr ""

#: ../../cadquery/doc/extending.rst:72
msgid ""
"Objects and points on the stack are **always** in global coordinates.  "
"Similarly, any objects you create must be created in terms of global "
"coordinates as well!"
msgstr ""

#: ../../cadquery/doc/extending.rst:77
msgid "Preserving the Chain"
msgstr ""

#: ../../cadquery/doc/extending.rst:79
msgid ""
"CadQuery's fluent API relies on the ability to chain calls together one "
"after another. For this to work, you must return a valid CadQuery object as "
"a return value.  If you choose not to return a CadQuery object, then your "
"plugin will end the chain. Sometimes this is desired for example "
":py:meth:`cadquery.Workplane.size`"
msgstr ""

#: ../../cadquery/doc/extending.rst:83
msgid "There are two ways you can safely continue the chain:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../cadquery/doc/extending.rst:85
msgid ""
"**return self**  If you simply wish to modify the stack contents, you can "
"simply return a reference to self.  This approach is destructive, because "
"the contents of the stack are modified, but it is also the simplest."
msgstr ""

#: ../../cadquery/doc/extending.rst:88
msgid ""
":py:meth:`cadquery.Workplane.newObject`  Most of the time, you will want to "
"return a new object.  Using newObject will return a new CQ or Workplane "
"object having the stack you specify, and will link this object to the "
"previous one.  This preserves the original object and its stack."
msgstr ""

msgid "Helper Methods"
msgstr ""

#: ../../cadquery/doc/extending.rst:96
msgid ""
"When you implement a CadQuery plugin, you are extending CadQuery's base "
"objects.  As a result, you can call any CadQuery or Workplane methods from "
"inside of your extension.  You can also call a number of internal methods "
"that are designed to aid in plugin creation:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../cadquery/doc/extending.rst:101
msgid ""
":py:meth:`cadquery.Workplane._makeWireAtPoints` will invoke a factory "
"function you supply for all points on the stack, and return a properly "
"constructed cadquery object. This function takes care of registering wires "
"for you and everything like that"
msgstr ""

#: ../../cadquery/doc/extending.rst:105
msgid ""
":py:meth:`cadquery.Workplane.newObject` returns a new Workplane object with "
"the provided stack, and with its parent set to the current object. The "
"preferred way to continue the chain"

msgid ""
":py:meth:`cadquery.Workplane.findSolid` returns the first Solid found in the"
" chain, working from the current object upwards in the chain. commonly used "
"when your plugin will modify an existing solid, or needs to create objects "
"and then combine them onto the 'main' part that is in progress"
msgstr ""

#: ../../cadquery/doc/extending.rst:112
msgid ""
":py:meth:`cadquery.Workplane._addPendingWire` must be called if you add a "
"wire.  This allows the base class to track all the wires that are created, "
"so that they can be managed when extrusion occurs."
msgstr ""

#: ../../cadquery/doc/extending.rst:115
msgid ""
":py:meth:`cadquery.Workplane.wire` gathers up all of the edges that have "
"been drawn ( eg, by line, vline, etc ), and attempts to combine them into a "
"single wire, which is returned. This should be used when your plugin creates"
" 2D edges, and you know it is time to collect them into a single wire."
msgstr ""

#: ../../cadquery/doc/extending.rst:119
msgid ""
":py:meth:`cadquery.Workplane.plane` provides a reference to the workplane, "
"which allows you to convert between workplane coordinates and global "
"coordinates: * :py:meth:`cadquery.occ_impl.geom.Plane.toWorldCoords` will "
"convert local coordinates to global ones * "
