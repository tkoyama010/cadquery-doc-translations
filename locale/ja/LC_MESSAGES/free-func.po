msgid ""
"For situations when more freedom in crafting individual objects is required,"
" a free function API is provided. This API has no hidden state, but may "
"result in more verbose code. One can still use selectors as methods, but all"
" other operations are implemented as free functions. Placement of objects "
"and creation of patterns can be achieved using the various overloads of the "
"moved method."

"The code above builds a non-trivial object by sequentially constructing "
"individual faces, assembling them into a solid and finally generating a "
"pattern."
msgstr ""

#: ../../cadquery/doc/free-func.rst:53
msgid "It begins with defining few edges."

msgid ""
"Those edges are used to create the side faces of the final solid using "
":meth:`~cadquery.occ_impl.shapes.loft`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../cadquery/doc/free-func.rst:68
msgid ""
"Once the side is there, :meth:`~cadquery.occ_impl.shapes.cap` and "
":meth:`~cadquery.occ_impl.shapes.fill` are used to define the top and bottom"
" faces. Note that :meth:`~cadquery.occ_impl.shapes.cap` tries to maintain "
"curvature continuity with respect to the context shape. This is not the case"
" for :meth:`~cadquery.occ_impl.shapes.fill`."

"Boolean operations are supported and implemented as operators and free "

msgstr ""

#: ../../cadquery/doc/free-func.rst:285
msgid ""
"In certain cases it is desirable to add features such as holes or "
"protrusions manually. E.g., for complicated shapes it might be beneficial "
"performance-wise because it avoids boolean operations. One can add or remove"
" faces, add holes to existing faces and last but not least reconstruct "
"existing solids."
msgstr ""

#: ../../cadquery/doc/free-func.rst:319
msgid ""
"If the base shape is more complicated, it is possible to use local sewing "
"that takes into account on indicated elements of the context shape. This, "
"however, necessitates a two step approach - first a shell needs to be "
"explicitly sewn and only then the final solid can be constructed."

"This in principle allows to model arbitrary shapes in the parametric domain,"
