"The purpose of this section is to explain how to import external file "
"formats into CadQuery, and export files from it as well. While the external "
"file formats can be used to interchange CAD model data with other software, "
"CadQuery does not support any formats that carry parametric data with them "
"at this time. The only format that is fully parametric is CadQuery's own "
"Python format. Below are lists of the import and export file formats that "
