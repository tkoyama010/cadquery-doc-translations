"Every operation from the face API accepts a mode parameter to define how to "
"combine the created object with existing ones. It can be fused "
"(``mode='a'``), cut (``mode='s'``), intersected (``mode='i'``), replaced "
"(``mode='r'``) or just stored for construction (``mode='c'``). In the last "
"case, it is mandatory to specify a ``tag`` in order to be able to refer to "
"the object later on. By default faces are fused together. Note the usage of "
"the subtractive and additive modes in the example above. The additional two "
"are demonstrated below."
