msgid "The purpose of this section is to explain how to import external file formats into CadQuery, and export files from it as well. While the external file formats can be used to interchange CAD model data with other software, CadQuery does not support any formats that carry parametric data with them at this time. The only format that is fully parametric is CadQuery's own Python format. Below are lists of the import and export file formats that CadQuery supports."
