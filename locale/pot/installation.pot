msgid "In principle, any Conda distribution will work, but it is probably best to install `Miniforge <https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge>`_ to a local directory and to avoid running `conda init`.  After performing a local directory installation, Miniforge can be activated via the [scripts,bin]/activate scripts. This will help avoid polluting and breaking the local Python installation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../cadquery/doc/installation.rst:23
msgid "Miniforge is a minimal installer that sets *conda-forge* as the default channel for package installation and provides `mamba <https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/mamba.html>`_.  You can swap almost all commands between conda & mamba."
