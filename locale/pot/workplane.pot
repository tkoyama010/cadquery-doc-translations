msgid "Most CAD programs use the concept of Workplanes. If you have experience with other CAD programs you will probably feel comfortable with CadQuery's Workplanes, but if you don't have experience then they are an essential concept to understand."

msgid "Workplanes represent a plane in space, from which other features can be located. They have a center point and a local coordinate system. Most methods that create an object do so relative to the current workplane."
msgstr ""

#: ../../cadquery/doc/workplane.rst:12
msgid "Usually the first workplane created is the \"XY\" plane, also known as the \"front\" plane. Once a solid is defined the most common way to create a workplane is to select a face on the solid that you intend to modify and create a new workplane relative to it. You can also create new workplanes anywhere in the world coordinate system, or relative to other planes using offsets or rotations."
msgstr ""

#: ../../cadquery/doc/workplane.rst:17
msgid "The most powerful feature of workplanes is that they allow you to work in 2D space in the coordinate system of the workplane, and then CadQuery will transform these points from the workplane coordinate system to the world coordinate system so your 3D features are located where you intended. This makes scripts much easier to create and maintain."

Or, you might extrude a box, and then select all of the vertical edges so that you can apply a fillet to them."

After that, any features you create are automatically combined (unless you specify otherwise) with that solid.  This happens even if the solid was created a long way up in the stack.  For example::"

Returning a new instance of :class:`~cadquery.Workplane` is the normal behaviour of most :class:`~cadquery.Workplane` methods (with some exceptions, as will be shown below) and this is how the `chaining`_ concept is implemented."
